Authentication
How It Works

User Registration (Signup)

User provides name, email, and password
System checks if email already exists
New user is created and stored in localStorage under ticketapp_users
Session is automatically created
User is redirected to dashboard

User Login

User provides email and password
System checks both test accounts and registered users
Password is verified
Session is created with 24-hour expiration
User is redirected to dashboard

Session Management

Session stored in localStorage under ticketapp_session
Contains: user info, token, expiration timestamp
Automatically expires after 24 hours
Checked on every protected route access

Logout

Clears session from localStorage
Redirects to landing page

Test Credentials
For quick testing, use these pre-configured accounts:
EmailPasswordNameuser@test.compassword123Test Useradmin@test.comadmin123Admin User
localStorage Keys
KeyPurposeData Structureticketapp*sessionCurrent user session{token, user: {id, email, name}, expiresAt}ticketapp_usersAll registered users[{id, name, email, password, createdAt}]ticketapp_tickets*{userId}User's tickets[{id, title, description, status, priority, ...}]

User-Specific Dashboards
Key Feature: Data Isolation
Each user has their own completely isolated ticket collection:

User A creates tickets → stored in ticketapp_tickets_userA_id
User B creates tickets → stored in ticketapp_tickets_userB_id
User A cannot see User B's tickets (and vice versa)

How It Works

When a user logs in, their unique userId is retrieved
All ticket operations use ticketapp*tickets*{userId} as the storage key
Demo tickets are created for new users automatically
Each user starts with 3 sample tickets to explore the interface

Benefits
✅ Privacy - Users can't access others' data
✅ Multi-user support - Multiple people can use the same device
✅ Clean separation - No data mixing or confusion
✅ Realistic simulation - Mimics real-world multi-tenant systems

Ticket Management
Ticket Data Model

status: "open", // Required: open | in_progress | closed
priority: "high", // Optional: low | medium | high
createdAt: "2025-10-26T10:30:00Z", // ISO timestamp
updatedAt: "2025-10-26T15:45:00Z" // ISO timestamp

🧪 Testing Guide
Manual Testing Checklist
Authentication Flow

Signup with new email → Should create account and login
Signup with existing email → Should show error
Login with correct credentials → Should redirect to dashboard
Login with wrong password → Should show error message
Login with non-existent email → Should show error message
Session persists after page refresh
Logout → Should clear session and redirect to home

Dashboard

Welcome message displays correct user name
Statistics show correct ticket counts
Quick action cards are clickable
"Manage Tickets" button navigates correctly

Ticket Management

Create ticket with all fields → Success
Create ticket with only title → Success (optional fields work)
Create ticket with empty title → Shows error
Create ticket with title > 100 chars → Shows error

Edit ticket → Pre-fills form correctly
Update ticket → Saves changes
Delete ticket → Shows confirmation, then removes
Real-time stats update after create/delete

User Isolation

Login as User A, create 2 tickets
Logout, signup as User B
User B should see only their 3 demo tickets (not User A's)

Environment Variables
For production, you may want to configure:

VITE_APP_NAME - Application name
VITE_API_URL - Backend API URL (if you add one)

⚠️ Known Limitations
Data Persistence

❌ localStorage only - data clears if user clears browser data
❌ No real database - data not accessible across devices
❌ No backup - data loss if localStorage corrupted

Security

⚠️ Passwords stored in plain text - NOT production-safe
⚠️ No encryption - data visible in localStorage
⚠️ Client-side only - no server-side validation
⚠️ Mock authentication - not suitable for real applications

Features

❌ No real-time sync - manual refresh needed
❌ No file attachments - tickets are text-only
❌ No user profiles - limited user data
❌ No email notifications - no external integrations
❌ No search functionality - only status filtering
❌ No ticket comments - no collaboration features
❌ No ticket assignments - no team management

Performance

⚠️ Large datasets - may slow down with 1000+ tickets
⚠️ No pagination - all tickets loaded at once
⚠️ No lazy loading - all components loaded upfront
